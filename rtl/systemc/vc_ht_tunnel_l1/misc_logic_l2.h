/**
	@description The goal of this module is to handle any logic that doesn't 
	really fitanywhere and to avoid putting in the top module in order to keep
	things clean.  You could also call this a "glue logic" module.  At this
	moment, the module includes:
	   - UnitID clumping logic
	   - Frequency changing logic
	   - Glue logic (ldtstopx registering)

   UnitID clumping logic. 
   ======================
   
   When reordering packets, we must take into account
   that some packets can not pass other packets when they are from the same
   UnitID.  But some UnitIDs can be "clumped" together so that two distinct
   unitID values represent the same logical unitID.  
   
   In the CSR, there is a vector that holds what unitIDs are clumped together.
   The logic here takes that vector and tranforms it into 32 number that
   the clumped unitID value for every individual real unitID.


   Frequency changing logic
   ========================

   The system always starts at a frequency of 200 MHz, that will most often
   be changed to a faster frequency later on.  The frequency is set in a
   register of the CSR, but it does not take effect immediately, we must
   wait for either 2us after resetx is asserted or when we are disconnected
   in an ldtstop sequence.

   This module takes the output from the CSR, the reset and the disconnected
   signal from the link and updates the value of the frequency sent to the 
   output of the tunnel for the circuit handling the clocking.

		UnitID represents devices in the chain.  But each unitID can only initiate
		32 non-posted transactions on the chain at one time.  To circumvent this
		limitation, devices can requests multiples UnitIDs.  Usually, traffic from
		different Unit ID's have no ordering rules between them, which can cause
		problem for a device that has mutltiple unitID's.  To solve this problem,
		unitID's can be "clumped" together to represent the same device so that
		ordering rules are respected for "clumped" unit ID's.

		The CSR contains the clumping configuration and this process converts it
		into 32 5-bit vectors which represent the "clumped" unitID represented
		by the 32 non-clumped unitIDs.  This can then be used by both side of
		the tunnel to enforce ordering rules.
