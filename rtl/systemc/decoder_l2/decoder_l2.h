///Input decoder for the Hypertransport module

/**
	@class decoder_l2
	@description The decoder has the task of first analyzing what dwords
	are received from the link and to organize them in packets
	that can be stored in the command buffer (reordering) or
	data buffer.  It also takes care of sending flow control (nop)
	information to the flow control module.

	When malformed or invalid packets are received, an error in logged
	but most likely, everything that will follow will be completely
	corrupted...   
	
	If the retry mode is on, it verifies that the
	per-packet CRC's are valid.  If they are not, then the decoder
	initiates a retry sequence.  It also ignores stomped packet.  If
	a stomped packet that has data associated is received, the data
	that's already stored in the databuffers is dropped.

	This is basically just a big state machine that directs the received
	dwords.  There are a lot of states because it is possible to insert
	a command packet inside a data transfer.  Per packet CRC's also complicate
	things quite a bit because there is no garantee in which order they will
	arrive when a command packet is inserted in a data transfer.  *Note: per
	packet CRC was simplified with revision 2.0b of the spec : inserted
	command CRC must follow the packet CRC.

  
	Contains the following sub-modules:

  		-state_machine
		-counter
		-cmd_buffer
		-cmdwdata_buffer
		-mux	
		-NOP_handler
		-historyRxCnt
