///Keeps track of the history of sent packets
/**
	@class history_buffer_l3
	@author Ami Castonguay
	@description

	The retry mode allows to attach a CRC to every packet.  If
	a packet is corrupted, the packet can simply be resent.  To
	be able to be resent, sent packets must be stored in a buffer.
	
	This sub-module takes care of managing the content of such
	a buffer.  This buffer is made to be used with a dual-port
	memory (one read port, one write port).
	 
	To keep track of the content of the buffer, a simple read pointer
	and a write pointer is kept.  When a new entry is created, a first
	dword is written in the memory which containes the tracking number
	and the size of the entry : this is the entry header.

	When a ack is received, the read pointer jumps from entry headers to
	the next entry header until either the ack number is reached or
	that the read pointer has reached the write pointer.

	The content of a header is :
		dword[7..0]  : ack value
		dword[12..8] : size of entry

	During retry playback, all that is stored in the history buffer will
	simply be resent.
